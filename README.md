The code preprocesses a CSV file containing data about chat GPT tweets and whether the tweets were good, bad, or neutral.
After tokenizing the data a scikit-learn support vector machine model was trained which had over 75% accuracy.
A neural network model using the TensorFlow library was also trained which had 77% accuracy.
The 2 models were compared by using the accuracy, recall, precision, and f1 score.
